# hy-octane - GitHub Extensions For hy-res

This project is an experiment in implementing a media type extension for
[hy-res](https://github.com/petejohanson/hy-res) that works w/ the hypermedia
format used by the [GitHub V3 API](https://developer.github.com/v3/)

It is still very much a work-in-progress.
